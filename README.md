# Performance Plots

mat2numpy script designed to read the matlab data of the literature plots to use as a comparison benchmark

All of the data arrays are stored in the Data/ folder, which contains the best performing runs in numpy format from the CNN's used. 

It also contains the data of the literature plots from the publication note digitized via matlab (.mat data).

The script uses matlplotlib (although seaborn can be used to enhance visuals), numpy and scipy.io is used for the matlab to numpy conversion.
